-Instrument
	-Base class defines three functions, connect, interact and disconnect. They basically call the corresponding adapter functions, with regard to the state of self.connected. On initialization, an attempt to connect is made, with self.connected variable indicating the result. Derived classes should override connect (first calling the base) for anything needed for (re)connection.
	-Connect should also try to reinstate all the initial parameters as well as those that are separately kept in the instrument (something to keep in mind generally). There is a concern what happens to parameters stored in the VInst, maybe a flag variable that reconnection has occurred would be necessary, but generally such redundant storage is probably better reduced.
	-The idea of disconnect function is to return the device to a state from which a new connect would be possible. This may concern both the adapter and the instrument. Though for some adapters (notably USBAdapter and also SDKAdapter) such disconnection appears to be tricky if not impossible.
	
	-Dealing with self.connected mainly in instrument? Probably. If not connected, let's return some edible value (adapter returns None so be careful with assuming there is a list. Though, to think about it, could we give a default value that wouldn't break the calling program. But this should pass the ZMQ scheme).
	-properties should be designed to return (quasi)immediately. Any longer asynchronous processes should be handled by higher levels, e.g. VI.

-Adapter
	-Base class defines three functions, connect, interact and disconnect. Additional functions can of course be defined, however for over-the-LAN operations, the server considers these three only.
	-connect
	-interact
		-The instrument may have multiple threads, so conflicts in accessing the hardware (= the corresponding driver) may occur. This might be the place to resolve it, because it also concerns ZMQAdapter
	-disconnect
	-we need to standardize the three main functions as to what (if any) parameters they have and what (if anything) is returned. Currently, connect - no parameters and returns boolean, disconnect - no parameters and no return, interact takes a list and returns a list. (We might think of a dictionary here, too). Problems - a) does connect have to return anything (maybe it does as this info is needed) and b) what about some additional parameters for interact (there is something in the SerialAdapter), can they be incorporated in the list (default values etc.)?
	-adapter also shouldn't have any internal parameters that are needed to be accessed directly from elsewhere (if only somehow through interact) because there may be no way to get to them in case of ZMQAdapter mediation.
-Virtual Instrument
-Server
	-ZMQAdapter sends out the device ID, which is the device name (we might wanna add some enumerator to the end of it, to support multiple instances of the same device, but we just need it to be same on the server and ZMQAdapter), function code and whatever is given to the function as a parameter. The connect/disconnect functions don't have parameters and interact has a list, so this is standard. It would probably be logical to pass the code within the record part, so whydontwe e.g. pass it as a (id, params) or just add id in front of the (possible) params list. We might also want to add the message counter, so [command_id, [params], counter]? And also add counter to the end of return so one can be sure this is the correct match?
-Procedure
	-A collection (one or more) of instruments or virtual instruments to perform a specific type of measurement or experiment in general.
